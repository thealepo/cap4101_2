- Fix default slider and selectbox settings
- Fix conversion problems
- Fix lightly_active, etc
- Fix data return problems

- consider implementing macronutrient split in the DCN tab
- consider implementing BMR into DCN tab (make it one huge important tab)

LIST FOR AUTO POWERED:
1. you need to define the person's bmi and other aspects to determine if they must lose, maintain, or gain weight
    - BMI
    - IBW
    - ABSI (optional)
    - BFP
    note: BFP contains a BMI calculator within
    note: should make a simple & advanced version (using st.radio)

SIMPLE: 
    - 
ADVANCED:
    - ABSI (waist_circumference)
    - BFSI (wrist_circumference) (gives frame)
    - IBW (using frame obtained from BFSI)
    BFSI -> IBW & ABSI

PLAN FOR AI IMPLEMENTATION:
    - create an SVM model for classification using the features = [BFSI , ABSI , ABSI z-score , mortality , bmi , weight_status] to predict whether or not a person must Lose Weight , Maintain , or Gain Waight. Considering also using their Current Weight and Ideal BodyWeight as features. Do not know where to get data from, might have to create my own, but its more about the principle of using ML to aide the use of the tool by beginners.

    - ML Implementation may take a while, and due to due date I will use normal if-else statements
    - Advanced: DCN , DWI , Macronutrient Distribution
    - Basic: DCN
